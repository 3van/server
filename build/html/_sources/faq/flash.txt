Flash FAQ
=========

Is Flash GPU acceleration supported?
------------------------------------

CasparCG does not support GPU acceleration for Flash. 


Is Stage3D supported?
---------------------

Yes, but only using the CPU fallback renderer.

Why isn't Flash audio embedded into the SDI signal?
---------------------------------------------------

CasparCG is currently unable to capture Flash audio since Flash sends audio directly to the system default audio device.
